# 🌐 PHASE 6 — REVERSE PROXY (TRAEFIK)

## 🎯 What we upgrade

We introduce a single entry point for the entire system.

We move from: multiple ports → unified gateway

---

## 🌐 TRAEFIK REVERSE PROXY

We add:

traefik/

It acts as the main gateway for all traffic.

---

## 🔀 ROUTING SYSTEM

All requests go through:

https://safesite.local

Then Traefik routes:

- /api → backend
- /auth → auth-service
- /ai → ai-service
- / → frontend

---

## ⚙️ WHAT TRAEFIK HANDLES

- request routing
- load balancing
- service discovery integration
- domain-based routing

---

## 🧠 RESULT OF PHASE 6

✔ single API gateway  
✔ production-style routing  
✔ centralized access point  
✔ load balancing system  

---

## 🚀 FINAL RESULT

SafeSite becomes a production-like API gateway architecture
